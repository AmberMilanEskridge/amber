Jtalk
=====

By Nicolas Petton <petton.nicolas@gmail.com>

Jtalk is an implementation of the Smalltalk language that runs on top of the JavaScript runtime. It is designed to make client-side development faster and easier.

Overview
--------

Jtalk is written in itself, including the parser and compiler. Jtalk compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping one-to-one with the equivalent JavaScript. There is no interpretation at runtime.

Some highlights:
- Jtalk features an IDE with a Class browser, workspace and transcript
- [Pharo Smalltalk](http://www.pharo-project.org) is considered as the reference implementation
- Jtalk includes a canvas to generate HTML, like [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st)
- Jtalk includes a [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) binding

License
-------

Jtalk is released under the MIT license.
